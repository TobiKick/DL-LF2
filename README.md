## Goal: 
Determine the best reinforcement learning approach for the Little Fighter 2 (LF2) game

## Tasks:
• Implementation of an agent that interacts with an environment for the LF2 game <br/>
• Comparison of the strategies Deep-Q-Learning (DQN) and Advantage Actor Critic (A2C) under which the agent took his deicisions <br/>
• Analysis of results based on win/lost ratio of each agent-strategy against a bot <br/>

## Outcome: 
In this project I could demonstrate that the A2C approach clearly outperformed DQN in the LF2 game

## Tools & Resources:
• Python, Keras, Tensorflow <br/>
• LF2 environment: https://github.com/elvisyjlin/lf2gym

## Project Setup
• **sh setup.sh** Downloads the open source LF2 from Project F and make it trainable (see here) <br/>
• **Install Python 3**Install Python 3 and get all dependencies <br/>
• **pip3 install -r requirements.txt** Install required packages <br/>
• **"python app.py"** Let your code run <br/>
