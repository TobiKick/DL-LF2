**"LittleFighter2"**
Project for the course Deep Learning Applications at National Taipei University of Technology


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
###### **SetUp for this project**
**sh setup.sh** Downloads the open source LF2 from Project F and make it trainable (see here).


**Install Python 3**Install Python 3 and get all dependencies.

**pip3 install -r requirements.txt** Install required packages

**"python app.py"** Let your code run

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
###### *NEXT STEPS / POINTS TO WORK ON: **
**Model creation** Develop a Model maybe with LSTM (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.02070.pdf)

**Optimization** Having a look at optimizing the Q function/learning reward, as the model is based on a simpler game and I think there should be some improvements possible when looking at the utilized data from the game

**Saving/Loading Model** Saving/Loading the Model / the agents progress
